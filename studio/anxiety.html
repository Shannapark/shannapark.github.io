    <p> You can't go wrong with Chocolate Chip Cookies. <br>It's a snack perfect for anytime of the year.<br> I remember making these with my little sister and <br>eating it right out of the oven while it's still hot with the chocolate melting.<br> I never really had Korean snacks growing up so our go to was chocolate chip cookies.</p>
